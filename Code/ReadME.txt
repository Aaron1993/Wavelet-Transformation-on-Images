To run this code in Matlab, Just add the folder directory to matlab and run Project_Wavelet_Transform.m

This Folder Consists:

1. Project_Wavelet_Transform.m		  --> Main script file. Just run this file in Matlab.
2. Compute_Wavelet_Coefficient.m	  --> Function made to decompose the image into wavelet coefficients.
3. Reconstruct_Using_Wavelet_Coefficient.m--> Function made to reconstruct the original Image using wavelet coefficients.
4. pconv.p				  --> Used for periodic convolution.
5. Report of the project
6. Problem Statement of the project
